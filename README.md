DESCRIPTION:-----

Today, I want to share something really interesting that I worked on—a Python program that fetches weather data from an online source and visualizes it in a simple and effective way. I made this program using Python libraries like requests, matplotlib, and numpy, along with an API to get real-time weather information.

What This Program Does:

This program pulls weather data for multiple cities, including New York, London, Tokyo, Mumbai, Sydney, and Dubai. It fetches details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, then presents them in a clear and colorful bar chart. The goal is to make weather comparisons between cities easy to understand at a glance.

How It Works:

Fetching Data: The program connects to an online weather API using the requests library and retrieves data for the specified cities.

Processing Data: It extracts key details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Visualizing Data: Using matplotlib and numpy, the data is plotted in a grouped bar chart, where each city is represented along the x-axis, and different bars show temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Libraries Used:

requests: To fetch real-time weather data from the API.

matplotlib: To create the visual representation of the data.

numpy: To manage and align the data efficiently.

Why This Is Useful:

This program is a simple yet powerful way to analyze weather conditions in different cities. Whether you want to compare weather before traveling or just for learning purposes, this visualization makes it easy to understand.

I really enjoyed building this, and I think it’s a great example of how Python can be used for real-world applications. Let me know what you think, and if you have any suggestions to improve it, I’d love to hear them!
